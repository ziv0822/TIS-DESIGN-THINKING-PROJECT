# Design Thinking – Low Fidelity Prototype

## Overview
This repository documents my Design Thinking assignment for the Technology and Information System (SECP1513) course. The project focuses on applying the design thinking process to develop a low fidelity prototype for a student expense tracking application.

## Project Summary
The design thinking process was conducted in several phases:
- Empathy: Understanding students’ spending behavior through surveys and interviews
- Define: Identifying overspending as a core problem due to the lack of effective expense tracking
- Ideate: Brainstorming features for an expense tracking application
- Prototype: Developing a low fidelity prototype using sketches and Figma
- Test and Deployment: Evaluating the prototype through user feedback

## Reflection
Through this design thinking project, I learned how to identify real user problems and translate user needs into practical system solutions. The process improved my ability to analyze user behavior, brainstorm ideas and develop prototypes at an early stage of system development. This experience strengthened my understanding of user-centered design and its importance in developing effective information systems.
